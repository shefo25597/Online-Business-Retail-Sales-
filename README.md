Online Business Retail Sales Analysis


About Dataset:
---

The datasets are from 'online retail sales'. Unfortunately, they have had to cut back from 25 employees to 5 because of the economic downturn with the corona virus.
Lets help them out with some informative kernels and visualizations! Anything and everything helps!

Project Analysis:

Data transformation:
--

- Remove duplicates values
- Remove null values
- create new column month_num to help me arrange months from January to December based on month_num
- create new column month_3 to get first 3 characters from Month colum to help me when create slicer based on column

Data Analysis:
----
These are questions that I initialy set out to answer:

- What is the total revenue every year?
- What months does the business generate the most revenue?
- What months does the business get the most orders?
- Is there a relationship between discounts or returns and months of the year?
- What is the total revenue for each product?
- What products lose us the most money in returns?
- What products were sold the most(in quantity)?


Data Visualization:
----
From the visuals and dashboard we can find that:

- The data set lacks other data that would help us solve the problem better, but through the existing data, I can provide some suggestions that help in finding a solution to the problem.
- If we look closely on dashboard we will find that only 6 products out of 18, account for roughly 90% of all revenue generated. These are the products for which there is noticable demand. 
My advice: Specialise the business on those 6 products for a start, terminate the rest.
- If we can focus on vastly improving the quality of those 6 products and vastly improve their marketing, it would be possible to easily achieve a 100% increase in net sales in a year.
